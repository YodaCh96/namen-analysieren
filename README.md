# Analysis of names with arrays

This exercise is intended to consolidate and deepen the use of arrays in C. At the same time, implicit type conversion from char to int (and vice versa) can be repeated. At the same time, the implicit type conversion from char to int can be repeated. On the content level, you should create a programme that analyses a name with regard to various aspects. The name to be analysed can be entered by the user when starting the programme. This is followed by various outputs.

Create a new project in Visual Studio to work on this task. Write all code that is necessary for processing this task directly into the main function of the newly created project. As an individual deepening, the individual components of the programme can be structured into different functions. This makes it possible, for example, to look at function calls with array parameters or pointers.

## Define array with all lower case letters

Declare and initialise an array containing all lowercase letters from a to z. Use a loop for this and consciously set the implicit type conversion between int and char.
